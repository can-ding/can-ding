Ball Paddle Game Engine
- This is a simple game engine built in JavaScript, the game involves controlling a paddle using the mouse to bounce randomly colored balls. The number of balls and their speed can be customized through input fields. The balls bounce off walls, and the game ends when all balls fall off the screen.

Features
- User Interaction:
    Move the paddle using the mouse.
    Adjust the number of balls and ball speed with input controls.
- Fixed-Time Step Game Loop:
    Ensures that game logic (ball movement) is consistent across devices regardless of frame rate.
- Variable Rendering:
    Game updates and rendering are decoupled, allowing smooth visuals while maintaining deterministic physics.
- Random Ball Colors:
    Each ball is assigned a random color at the start of the game for a unique visual experience each time.
